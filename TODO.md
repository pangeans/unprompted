# Overview
- The project is a game where the user is shown an ai-generated picture and an input field.  
- Use TailwindCSS components
- They have to guess the prompt keywords. 
- The game runs in 5 rounds
Round 1-2: Need to guess plaintext
Round 3-4: Add non-essential connector words: (and, but, with, who, etc)
Round 5: Add multiple choice words for final round
- If word is correct, make it green, if not make it red
- After the game runs, give the user a share button that copies a plaintext representation of the game.
