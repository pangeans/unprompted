# Update Scheduling Logic

## Overview
- Currently, we can only schedule games down to the exact day.
- This is because we only store the date without time in the NeonDB.
- Please update this and make the changes wherever is necessary in the backend/frontend files and databases.

## Notes
- Generate a markdown report with your changes and decision-making.
