## Target app: frontend

Users should only be able to play the game once a day.
Please suggest the best and easiest ways to achieve this.
When the user completes the game, the page should display the unblurred image/video, the filled-in prompt, the score squares, and a timer to the next scheduled game (if any).
If no games are scheduled, just say "No games currently schedueld."

## Notes
- Write clean and minimally viable code, with minimal error handling. 
- I want the code to be readable, easy to understand and easy to test (later). 
- Write a markdown file that explains how you end up solving this problem.
